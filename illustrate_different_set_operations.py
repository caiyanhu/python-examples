# Program to perform different set operations like in mathematics

# define two sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# set union
print("Union of E and N is", E | N)
# set intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is", E & N)
# set difference
print("Difference of E and N is", E - N)
# set sysmetric difference
print("Sysmetric difference of E and N is", E ^ N)
